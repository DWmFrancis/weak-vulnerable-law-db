  <h1>Pardon Power â€“ U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 2</h1>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Watchlist</p>
  <p>The presidential pardon power has been subject to potential abuse due to its broad and largely unchecked nature. It has been used to reward allies, obstruct investigations, or preempt judicial proceedings. While legal, these uses raise significant questions about ethics, accountability, and separation of powers.</p>
