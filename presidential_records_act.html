        <h1>Presidential Records Act – 44 U.S. Code §§ 2201–2209</h1>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Vulnerable</p>
        <p>Designed to ensure presidential documents are preserved, this law is weakly enforced. It lacks real-time oversight and penalties for non-compliance, allowing records to be hidden, delayed, or destroyed without timely consequence.</p>
