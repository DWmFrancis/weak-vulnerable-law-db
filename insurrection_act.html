        <h1>Insurrection Act – 10 U.S. Code §§ 251–255</h1>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> High Risk</p>
        <p>This act allows the President to deploy military forces within the United States under vague and broad circumstances.
        It lacks adequate congressional oversight or judicial review, which makes it prone to misuse during political crises or civil unrest.</p>
