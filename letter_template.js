const letterTemplates = {"appointments_clause": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nI\"m writing to express deep concern over the ongoing misuse of the Appointments Clause through the excessive use of "acting" officials. This loophole undermines the Senate\"s constitutional role of advice and consent and allows extended, unchecked executive control.\n\nI urge you to support legislation that caps acting appointments and requires timely Senate confirmation or automatic expiration.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Name]", "emergency_powers": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nThe unchecked breadth of presidential emergency powers is a growing threat to our democratic institutions. With over 130 emergency authorities potentially triggered with minimal oversight, the need for reform is urgent.\n\nPlease support legislation requiring periodic reauthorization and transparency whenever emergency powers are invoked.\n\nThank you,  \n[Your Name]", "hatch_act": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nThe Hatch Act was intended to prevent the use of public office for partisan politics. Yet today, repeated violations go unpunished, eroding public trust.\n\nI ask you to strengthen enforcement by creating an independent oversight body and applying meaningful consequences for repeat violations.\n\nRespectfully,  \n[Your Name]", "insurrection_act": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nThe Insurrection Act grants sweeping power to deploy federal troops domestically, yet its standards are vague and its use unreviewable. History warns us of the dangers.\n\nI urge you to demand strict limitations and mandatory Congressional review for any future invocation.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Name]", "pardon_power": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nPresidential pardon power was never meant to shield allies from accountability or obstruct justice. Its recent misuse threatens equal justice under the law.\n\nPlease consider introducing or supporting constitutional reforms that limit pardon use in cases involving the president’s own administration or personal interests.\n\nWith hope,  \n[Your Name]", "presidential_records_act": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nThe Presidential Records Act lacks the enforcement power needed to preserve our nation’s historical and legal integrity. Violations have occurred without consequence.\n\nI urge you to support efforts to strengthen the PRA with criminal penalties and real-time auditing capabilities.\n\nThank you,  \n[Your Name]", "emoluments_clause": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nForeign influence through personal financial gain is exactly what the Emoluments Clause was designed to prevent. Yet enforcement has failed due to ambiguity and inaction.\n\nI urge you to support laws that define “emolument,” require disclosures, and enable enforcement of this essential constitutional safeguard.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Name]", "westfall_act": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nThe Westfall Act is being misused to shield government officials from civil liability, even in personal matters like defamation. This undermines public accountability.\n\nI ask you to introduce clear limits on Westfall protections and ensure citizens retain their right to seek justice.\n\nRespectfully,  \n[Your Name]", "fec_enforcement": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nCampaign finance laws are being rendered meaningless by a deadlocked FEC and the explosion of dark money. Voters deserve transparency and timely enforcement.\n\nPlease support reforms to restructure the FEC, mandate donor disclosure, and limit abuse of pass-through organizations.\n\nWith concern,  \n[Your Name]", "presidential_transition_act": "Dear [Representative Name],\n\nThe peaceful transition of power is a cornerstone of American democracy. The Presidential Transition Act must be strengthened to ensure timely, nonpartisan cooperation.\n\nI ask you to support legislation that imposes deadlines and penalties for obstruction, regardless of political affiliation.\n\nThank you,  \n[Your Name]"};
