        <p><strong>Risk Score:</strong> 4 (Significant)</p>
        <p><strong>Vulnerability Types:</strong> Executive Overreach, Loophole Exploitation</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Governs how public officials are appointed, allowing the President to appoint with Senate confirmation or via recess appointments.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical Usage:</strong> Recess appointments have been used to bypass Senate resistance; challenged in court (e.g., NLRB v. Noel Canning).</p>
        <p><strong>Flagged Abuse Scenarios:</strong> Use of acting appointments to bypass Senate scrutiny; politicized hiring of key agency heads.</p>
        <p><strong>Suggested Reforms:</strong> Limit duration of acting roles; require Senate confirmation for key executive positions.</p>
