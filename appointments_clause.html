        <h1>Appointments Clause – U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 2, Clause 2</h1>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Vulnerable</p>
        <p>This clause grants the President power to appoint officers with Senate confirmation, but loopholes allow long-term “acting” appointments without oversight, diminishing the Senate’s role and weakening accountability.</p>
