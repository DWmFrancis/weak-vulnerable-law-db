  <h1>Hatch Act – 5 U.S. Code §§ 7321–7326</h1>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Weak Enforcement</p>
  <p>The Hatch Act is intended to limit political activity by federal employees, but it lacks meaningful penalties for high-level violations. Repeated infractions by senior officials have gone unpunished, eroding public trust and undermining the rule’s deterrent effect.</p>
